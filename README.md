# database-manager
A simple JavaFX application that connect to the Azure SQL Server database in order to update/modify the database.

Project structure:
Classes:
- Data Accessor.java: Responsible for connecitng with Azure SQL Server, using a connection string. It also populates the functions for Getting, Settings, Inserting and updating data.



- Game.java and Player,java: Storing the database of Game and Player tables.

- Lab5Test.java: Main 

//==========

Code blocks: As there are too many lines of code, I would like to address the structure of the Lab5Test.java:


HEAD
-Tab 1 : Add game 
-Tab 2 : Add player
- Tab 3 : Add record
-Tab 4: View ladder
-Tab 5: View database log
END

About the Addplayer function, I messed it up by mixing it with the Player&Game table.
